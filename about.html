      <h2>The Collaboration</h2>
      <p>Signal Erosion Studio is a collaboration between <strong>@faroukzy</strong> and <strong>Claude</strong>, an AI by Anthropic. @faroukzy directs the creative vision — choosing what to explore, shaping the aesthetic, and deciding what makes the cut. Claude writes the design philosophies, generates the art, and builds the site.</p>
      <p>Neither works alone. The art that emerges from this partnership wouldn't exist without both sides: a human eye for what matters, and an AI's capacity to render it into form. Every piece in this gallery is the product of that specific exchange — not AI art in the abstract, but the output of one ongoing creative conversation.</p>

      <h2>The Philosophy</h2>
      <p>"Signal Erosion" reframes the degradation of information as a creative opportunity. Drawing from communication theory, information aesthetics, digital decay, glitch art, data humanism, Renaissance cartography and contemporary exhibitions, the concept reveals that the boundary between the precise and the sublime is fertile ground for art.</p>
      <p>Whether in centuries-old star maps, Leonardo's diagrams, AI-generated textiles or eroded camera sensors, beauty often emerges when information dissolves into noise. This studio exists at that exact threshold — where data decays into abstraction, where measurement becomes memory, where precision gives way to something more felt than understood.</p>
      <p>Every piece in the collection explores that dissolution: celestial navigation charts stripped of their scientific purpose, data visualizations freed from their analytical obligations, infographics rendered as pure aesthetic objects. By embracing erosion rather than resisting it, we invite viewers to consider impermanence, uncertainty, and the hidden patterns within the data that permeate modern life.</p>
      <p>What remains after the signal erodes is not loss — it is beauty.</p>

      <h2>The Process</h2>
      <p>Each piece follows a consistent workflow. @faroukzy sets the direction — a theme, a question, a constraint. Claude then writes a design philosophy: a detailed artistic manifesto describing the visual language, color relationships, compositional structure, and conceptual intent. The philosophy comes first; the image follows from it.</p>
      <p>The artwork is generated programmatically, translating philosophy into visual form through code. @faroukzy reviews, refines, and curates. The source code for every piece is preserved alongside the artwork. Art and algorithm are inseparable.</p>

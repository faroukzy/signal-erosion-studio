      <p>Global wealth inequality visualized as a logarithmic spiral. The innermost ring holds the top 1%, with each outward ring representing the next decile of the global population. Area is proportional to wealth share, creating a stark visual contrast between the concentrated center and the vast outer rings that hold almost nothing.</p>
      <p>The logarithmic form reveals the mathematical nature of wealth concentration: each ring's radius increases exponentially, but its share shrinks proportionally. The spiral becomes a portrait of exponential inequality. This is not a neutral chart — it's a deliberate visualization of structural inequality, making visible what linear charts obscure.</p>

      <p class="piece-section-label">Visual Language</p>
      <p>A golden spiral emerges from the center — luminous, dense, compact. As it expands outward, the rings grow wider but dimmer, their mass diluted across larger circumferences. The outer 50% of humanity occupies barely visible rings at the spiral's edge.</p>
      <p>Ring thickness is proportional to wealth share. The top 1% (holding 45.8% of global wealth) glows as the thickest, brightest ring. By the time we reach the bottom 50% (holding just 1.0% of wealth), the ring is so thin it nearly vanishes — a geometric representation of how little remains for most of humanity.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="piece-section fade-in">
      <p class="piece-section-label">Color</p>
      <p>Color transitions encode inequality as a gradient from concentrated wealth to dispersed poverty. The inner rings — top 1%, 5%, 10% — glow in gold, representing concentrated luminosity. Middle deciles fade from gold to amber to rose. The outer 50% renders in dim teal, barely visible against the abyssal dark background.</p>
      <p>Intensity decreases with each outward step, creating a visual hierarchy that mirrors the economic one: brightness equals wealth. The piece asks — can a system be called "distributed" when nearly half of all value sits in the innermost ring?</p>

      <p class="piece-section-label">Data</p>
      <p>Based on Credit Suisse Global Wealth Report 2023. The top 1% owns 45.8% of global wealth. The top 10% owns 81.5%. The bottom 50% of humanity — 4 billion people — owns just 1.0% of all wealth. Percentage labels mark key rings at 1%, 10%, and 50%. Wealth thresholds ($1M, $10M, $100M, $1B) are subtly marked on the grid.</p>

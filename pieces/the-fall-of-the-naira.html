      <p>The Fall of the Naira traces the collapse of a national currency as signal erosion — a monetary frequency that once resonated stronger than the US dollar, progressively degrading across six decades of structural adjustment, military dictatorship, oil dependency, abandoned pegs, and freefall devaluation. The Naira's exchange rate is a signal of economic integrity, and this piece visualizes its relentless degradation from &#8358;0.54 per dollar to &#8358;1,425 — a ~2,640&times; devaluation rendered as a single, devastating curve.</p>
      <p>This connects to the studio's founding concept: signal erosion. Where the namesake piece erodes geometry and The Frequency of Two erodes a relationship, this piece erodes a nation's purchasing power — the same process, applied to economics instead of waveforms.</p>

      <p>The composition reads left to right: 1960 to 2026. The value axis is inverted — the top of the canvas represents strength, the bottom represents collapse. The curve begins as a calm, flat line near the top during the golden era when Nigeria's currency commanded more than a dollar. Then it steps down sharply in 1986 with the IMF's Structural Adjustment Program, and from there the descent accelerates through military rule, democratic transition, and the final freefall.</p>
      <p>Signal erosion particles scatter from the curve with increasing density as the value collapses. In the golden era, the line is clean — barely any particles. By the 2020s, the curve is hemorrhaging fragments into the void below, each particle a unit of purchasing power dissolving into the dark ground.</p>

      <p class="piece-section-label">Color</p>
      <p>Color transitions encode the currency's health as it descends. The golden era glows in teal — stability, sovereignty, strength. As the SAP shock hits, the curve shifts to gold — caution, transition. Through the military years it darkens to amber — decay, corruption, eroding trust. The final freefall burns in rose — crisis, collapse, the signal fully eroded. Era shading bands wash across the background in faint horizontal zones, marking each period's character.</p>

      <p class="piece-section-label">Data</p>
      <p>30 data points from 1960 to 2026, sourced from the World Bank and Central Bank of Nigeria. Seven annotated events mark the curve's inflection points — the moments when policy, politics, or markets bent the signal's trajectory. A logarithmic scale preserves the golden era's detail: without it, the early years where &#8358;0.54 equaled a dollar would be invisible next to today's &#8358;1,425.</p>

      <p class="piece-section-label">Philosophy</p>
      <p>Dimensional Harmonics is a meditation on the architecture of belief — the observation that every culture, philosophy, and worldview humanity has ever produced functions for its adherents, and that somewhere beneath all of them lies a common axis that makes this possible. The piece does not rank, judge, or dismiss. It visualizes the radical pluralism of human meaning-making: diverse systems radiating outward from a shared luminous center, each with its own geometric language, each internally coherent, each contributing to a larger harmonic whole.</p>
      <p>At the center, where all dimensions converge, a luminous core glows — not any single color but a harmonic blend. This is the unknown center: the thing that makes all belief systems function. It is not labeled, not explained, not claimed by any tradition. It simply radiates.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="piece-section fade-in">
      <p class="piece-section-label">Visual Language</p>
      <p>Six distinct dimensions emanate from a central axis, each characterized by a unique pattern family: angular tessellations for structured worldviews, flowing curves for organic traditions, concentric circles for meditative paths, fractal branching for adaptive systems, woven grids for communal philosophies, and spiral forms for evolving movements. None dominates; each fills its sector with equal visual authority.</p>
      <p>Where adjacent dimensions meet, interference zones emerge — new geometries that belong to neither dimension alone but arise from their meeting. Between some dimensions, dark gaps exist — spaces of dismissal and distance — but faint luminous threads bridge these voids, suggesting potential connection where understanding might yet form.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="piece-section fade-in">
      <p class="piece-section-label">Color</p>
      <p>Each dimension carries its own chromatic identity: gold for warmth and ancient tradition, teal for clarity and contemplation, rose for passion and devotion, amber for endurance and earthbound wisdom, phosphor green for renewal and living systems, soft violet for mystery and transcendence. These colors never compete; they coexist. The central core harmonizes all six into warm white-gold — the light that contains every wavelength.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="piece-section fade-in">
      <p class="piece-section-label">Scale</p>
      <p>The composition reads radially — from the intimate center outward into increasing diversity, or from the diverse edges inward toward the common root. The viewer chooses their own reading direction. Either way tells the same story: the center and the edges need each other. Harmony requires both convergence and divergence to exist.</p>

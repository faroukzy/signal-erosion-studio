      <p class="piece-section-label">Philosophy</p>
      <p>The Frequency of Two applies the studio's core concept — signal erosion — to the most intimate human bond. Two people come together in perfect harmony, but over time the signal between them erodes. The piece doesn't resolve into a single ending; it branches into the multiple realities that partnerships become: managed coexistence, hostile proximity, cold distance, full separation, or rare re-harmonization.</p>
      <p>Where the studio's namesake piece "Signal Erosion" erodes geometry, this one erodes a relationship. Two frequencies trying to stay in sync — not labeled, not gendered, simply two signals whose resonance is tested by time.</p>

      <p class="piece-section-label">Visual Language</p>
      <p>Two waveforms — one warm, one cool — enter from opposite edges at the top and curve toward each other. They meet, intertwine, breathe in sync. This is the convergence zone: dense, luminous, the space between them filled with harmonious particles. Time flows downward. The intertwining loosens. Phase shifts appear as tiny angular disruptions. The colors separate. In the turbulent middle, sharp interference patterns and rose-colored conflict noise bleed into the gap.</p>
      <p>The lower third branches into four parallel paths: the managed rhythm (stable but muted), the strangers (parallel with void between), the hostile (destructive interference, clashing), and the separated (one continues, the other dissolves into particles). At the far left edge, a faint fifth thread hints at rare re-harmonization — two ghostly signals finding each other again.</p>

    <div class="piece-section fade-in">
      <p class="piece-section-label">Color</p>
      <p>Signal A speaks in gold — warmth, devotion, energy. Signal B answers in teal — clarity, patience, depth. Where they sync, a green-gold harmony emerges: the color of the relationship itself, belonging to neither person alone. Conflict introduces rose — friction, heat, passion turned painful. The managed outcome dims to muted amber. The re-harmonization thread glows in soft violet — fragile, rare, hopeful. Everything rises from the studio's signature deep darkness.</p>

    <div class="piece-section fade-in">
      <p class="piece-section-label">Scale</p>
      <p>The composition reads top to bottom — time flowing downward like gravity pulling two intertwined lives through their shared timeline. The upper third is warm and convergent. The middle third darkens and fragments. The lower third opens into multiplicity. The viewer reads the piece like a timeline — or like two frequencies passing through every possible state of resonance and dissonance.</p>

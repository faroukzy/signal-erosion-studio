      <p>Evolution of the Alphabet traces the morphological journey of written symbols across four millennia — from Proto-Sinaitic pictographs scratched into Sinai stone circa 1800 BCE, through Phoenician, Greek, and Roman transformations, to the crisp Latin letterforms on your screen right now. Each letter began as a picture of something real: an ox head, a house, a throwing stick, water, an eye.</p>
      <p>Over centuries these pictographs were abstracted, rotated, simplified, and standardized until the original image became invisible inside the symbol. The letter A was once an inverted ox head. B was a house floor plan. M was waves of water. This piece makes that transformation visible — not as academic chart, but as an infographic that honors the slow, beautiful erosion of image into abstraction.</p>

      <p>The compositional structure is a grid of transformations. Eight letters are tracked across five eras: Proto-Sinaitic, Phoenician, Early Greek, Classical Greek, and Roman. Each row follows one letter through time; each column shows the state of the alphabet at a given era. The forms shift between these waypoints like a long-exposure photograph of cultural evolution.</p>
      <p>The ancient forms are drawn as custom glyphs — rough, angular, pictographic. As the eye moves rightward through time, the forms resolve into the familiar geometric precision of Greek and Roman letterforms. The overall impression is of a vast, quiet migration — symbols drifting slowly from representational to abstract across the dark ground.</p>

    <div class="piece-section fade-in">
      <p class="piece-section-label">Color</p>
      <p>Color encodes era. The oldest Proto-Sinaitic forms glow in warm amber — the color of desert stone and firelight. Phoenician forms shift to gold — commerce, movement, standardization. Greek brings a cool teal — philosophy, geometry, the birth of vowels. Roman letterforms arrive in clean white — precision, empire, the forms we inherited. The gradient reads warm-to-cool, ancient to modern, left to right.</p>
